  <p><a href="https://www.siddharthindustries.biz/">Siddharth Industries</a> was started by Mr Raghu Khemka (BTech Chemical) in the year 1995. A young man with a keen scientific acumen, Mr Raghu Khemka chose to leave the relatively cushy work as the manager of family owned automotive dealership.
    Having completed his MBA, he began his own venture in the chemical industry by chipping in his savings. Leveraging on manganese and iron ore reserves of India, he saw an opportunity to develop various value added products. His journey took him
